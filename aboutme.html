                <p>I am enrolled in a course called E-Business System 1.<br />
                    I believe this course is to provide an understanding of e-business and its importance integrated with the e-commerce, which is
                    increasingly growing in these years. The course can help me to accquire a range of skills such as Business Systems Integration and creative business solutions.<br /> 
                    I think that the term Web 2.0 refers to a second generation of the World Wide Web that is focused on the ability for people to collaborate and share information online including 
                    blogs, wiki, RSS and social bookmarking.

                <p>
                    The term "Mobile Commerce" refers to the acts of browsing, buying, ordering and selling products and services on mobile phones and tablets <a href = "http://onlinebusiness.volusion.com/articles/what-is-m-commerce/"><i>(What Is M-commerce and What Is Its Future?)</i></a>.<br />
                    Right now, the mobile phone is replacing personal pockets and credit cards <a href = "http://mcom.cs.cmu.edu/"><i>(Mobile Commerce Lab)</i></a>.<br />
                    Realizing the growth of Mobile Commerce, many companies start to spread out their mobile marketing sent to the customers' mobile devices and it is reported that the mobile marketing
                    is far effective than the traditional marketing campaigns <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_commerce#Mobile_purchase"><i>(Mobile Commerce)</i></a>.
